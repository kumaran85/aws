ALB works on layer 7.
Supports SSL certificates based on ACM and from IAM.
Public subnets are ueds to configure LB.

Option is choose certificate from ACM orr IAM.
ALB supports rule condition both path and host based routing.

For Scheme, an Internet-facing load balancer routes requests from clients over the Internet to
targets. An internal load balancer routes requests to targets using private IP addresses.

dualstack means both ipv4 and ipv6

Host based routing is host field of the http header.
path based is based on URL path of the http header.

Containerized application support multiple port on same instance.
Sticky sessions mechanism is to route client request to same target group. stickiness defined at targer group level.
For stcicky session we can set duration.
accidential delete protection.
Back-End server encryption.

creating target group option is target type has two values 1.instance(instance ID) 2.ip(route traffic to one or more interfaces).

connetion Idle timeout if no data send ELB closes connection. In apache enable keep alive to enable data transmission. So ELB will data to send untill keep alive timeout.

we can send 128 parallel requests using one HTTP/2.

Two types rule condition 1. host 2. path Each rule can have one host and path condition.

3 types of rule action:
1. authenticate-congnito
2.authenticate-oidc (use Identiy proivider to open ID connect.
3..Forward . Each rule must include forward action 

Default security policy 2016-08 supports TLS 1, 1.1, 1.2.

Clients can use Server Name Identification(SNI) to specify hostname they're trying.
